          <h2 class="mb-2 text-xl font-bold dark:text-white">Founder Omar Hamdan</h2>
          <p>A developer and founder with over three years of experience developing,deploying, and designing all kinds of applications from ETL pipelines and reports, to reusable libraries and frameworks, to web applications with small user bases of a few hundred people up to ones for millions.</p>
          <p>In that time, he worked with all kinds of project managers and different teams, and while he found they generally tried to use good software development methodologies and tools for keeping track of the project tasks, the results were often varied in how successful they were. This was because they addressed a small subset of the software development process did not connect these good practices together, and were not flexable to different development approaches or designing.</p>
          <p>He always wanted to be able to help lots of companies solve their technical challenges and loved doing all kinds of development. This is why he offers all these services today. And the software he is building is his attempt to help even more people than he ever could even with an army of workers behind him.</p>
